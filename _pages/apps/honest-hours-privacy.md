## Our Commitment to Privacy

Honest Hours is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your time tracking data belongs to you and stays on your Mac. This policy explains what information we collect (spoiler: almost nothing) and how we handle your data.

## Information We Collect

### Zero External Data Collection
- **No analytics**: We don't use any analytics services
- **No telemetry**: No usage data is sent anywhere
- **No accounts**: No registration or sign-in required
- **No network calls**: The app works entirely offline

## Data Storage

### Your Data Stays Local
- All time tracking data is stored locally on your Mac using CoreData
- Focus session history and blocked app settings are stored only on your device
- Your activity data never leaves your computer
- We have no ability to access your data

### What Gets Stored Locally
- Application names and time spent
- Browser tab titles and URLs (for Safari, Chrome, Brave)
- Focus session records (completed, abandoned, duration)
- Blocked apps list and block attempt counts
- App preferences and settings

## Data We Don't Collect

Honest Hours does NOT track or store:
- Keyboard input or keystrokes
- Screenshots or screen recordings
- File contents or document names
- Network traffic or browsing history (beyond active tab titles)
- Personal identification information
- Location data
- Any data on external servers

## Permissions

Honest Hours requires these permissions to function:

- **Accessibility**: To detect the active application and browser tabs
- **Automation (AppleScript)**: To read browser tab URLs for time tracking

These permissions are used exclusively for time tracking on your device. No data is transmitted externally.

## Data Export and Deletion

### Export Your Data
- Export all your data as CSV anytime from Settings
- Your data, your format, your control

### Delete Your Data
- Use "Reset All Data" in Settings to permanently delete everything
- Uninstalling the app removes all associated data

- No analytics platforms
