## The Story Behind Thadam

### What's in a Name?
*Thadam* (தடம்) is a Tamil word meaning "track" or "path" — a fitting name for an app that helps you navigate Chennai's suburban railway network.

### The Inspiration
This app draws inspiration from the classic 1990s railway station boards that many Chennai commuters remember fondly. The nostalgic blackboard aesthetic with chalk-style text brings back memories of simpler times while providing modern functionality.

Thadam has been completely rebuilt from the ground up using SwiftUI, replacing an older Objective-C version that served commuters for years. The new version offers a beautiful, intuitive interface designed for today's iOS devices.
