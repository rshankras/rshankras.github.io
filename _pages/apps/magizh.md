## The Story Behind Magizh

### What's in a Name?
*Magizh* (pronounced "Ma-ghi-l") is a beautiful Tamil word that means joy or happiness. 

### The Inspiration
This app was born from a profound quote by Kurt Vonnegut in his collection "If This Isn't Nice, What Is?":

> "And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.'" 
> ‚Äî Kurt Vonnegut

In our fast-paced world, we often forget to pause and acknowledge the moments that bring us joy. Magizh is designed to help you capture and cherish these fleeting instances of happiness.
