## HealthKit Integration

ChantFlow automatically logs your mindful minutes to the Health app, helping you track your overall wellness journey alongside other health metrics.

### Health Tracking (Your Heart Rate Tells All)

We added health tracking because apparently "feeling zen" isn't quantifiable enough anymore. Now you can watch your heart rate drop in real-time as you chant your way to inner peace.

**What's New:**
- **Heart rate monitoring** (works every time!)
- **Health insights dashboard** with session tracking
- **HRV data** (experimental - like your meditation practice)

*HRV requires perfect conditions: 5+ minutes, statue-like stillness, and probably some good karma.*

## Perfect For

- **Meditation practitioners** seeking a structured daily routine
- **Spiritual seekers** following traditional 108 count practices
- **Mindfulness enthusiasts** who prefer minimalist, focused apps
- **Apple Watch users** who want a dedicated meditation companion

## Technical Details

- **Platform**: Apple Watch (watchOS)
- **HealthKit Integration**: Automatic mindful minutes logging
- **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Real-time tracking during practice

- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive statistics and streaks
- **Customization**: Adjustable chant intervals and reminders

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What makes ChantFlow different from other meditation apps?**
ChantFlow is specifically designed for Apple Watch with a focus on the traditional 108 Sacred Count practice. It's minimalist, distraction-free, and integrates seamlessly with your health tracking. The unique extra credits feature allows you to honor the sacred tradition while providing flexibility for extended practice sessions. Plus, you can now watch your heart rate drop in real-time as you chant - because apparently "feeling zen" isn't quantifiable enough anymore.

**Can I use ChantFlow for different types of meditation?**
Yes! While designed for Om chanting, ChantFlow works perfectly for any mantra repetition, prayer counting, or sacred practice that benefits from structured counting.

**What are the extra credits feature?**
After completing the traditional 108 count, you can continue your practice with extra credits. The app tracks these as "+ extras" (e.g., "108 + 4"), allowing you to extend your meditation when you feel called to continue beyond the sacred number.

**How does the haptic feedback work?**
Gentle vibrations guide your rhythm during practice, helping you maintain consistent timing without looking at the screen. Perfect for maintaining focus during meditation.

**What's this HRV thing about?**
HRV (Heart Rate Variability) is like a window into your nervous system's zen level. It requires perfect conditions: 5+ minutes of practice, statue-like stillness, and probably some good karma. Consider it a bonus feature for the truly dedicated practitioners.
