## Features

### Daily Om Ritual
Start each day with sacred Om chanting, guided by gentle haptic rhythm on your Apple Watch. Build a consistent daily practice that brings inner balance and spiritual transformation.

### Sacred 108 Tradition

### Core Features

- **Heart rate reduction tracking** - see your stress melt away (e.g., 87 → 80 bpm)
- **Health insights dashboard** with session tracking
- **Complete privacy** - all data stays in Apple Health

### Universal Spiritual Tool
Perfect for Om chanting, mantra repetition, prayer counting, or any sacred practice. Cultivate inner balance through consistent daily ritual on your Apple Watch. The extra credits feature allows you to extend your practice when you feel called to continue beyond the traditional 108 count.

## Heart Rate Insights - Your Meditation, Measured

Ever wondered if meditation is really working? Now you can see it happening. ChantFlow tracks your heart rate before, during, and after each session - so you can watch your stress literally melt away as you chant.

### Heart Rate Sessions View
Browse all your meditation sessions by date and see detailed insights:
- **Your heart rate journey** from start to finish (e.g., 87 bpm → 80 bpm)
- **Heart rate reduction percentage** for each session
- **Performance badges** showing excellent, very good, or good sessions based on heart rate improvement
- **Daily summaries** when you practice multiple times

### Session Summaries
Two minutes after you finish meditating (giving you time to rest in the silence), you can choose to see a gentle summary showing your heart rate improvement and session duration. Or turn summaries off if you prefer to just practice without the data.

### Complete Privacy
All your health data stays in your Apple Health app - we never see it, store it, or share it. You can turn health tracking off entirely anytime.

### How It Works
Just enable Health Tracking in Settings and give ChantFlow permission to read your health data. That's it. From then on, every meditation session automatically captures your heart rate and shows you how your practice is helping your body find calm.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What makes ChantFlow different from other meditation apps?**
ChantFlow is specifically designed for Apple Watch with a focus on the traditional 108 Sacred Count practice. It's minimalist, distraction-free, and integrates seamlessly with your health tracking. The unique extra credits feature allows you to honor the sacred tradition while providing flexibility for extended practice sessions. Plus, you can now watch your heart rate drop in real-time as you chant and get performance badges showing how effective each session was at helping you find calm.

**Can I use ChantFlow for different types of meditation?**
Yes! While designed for Om chanting, ChantFlow works perfectly for any mantra repetition, prayer counting, or sacred practice that benefits from structured counting.

**What are the extra credits feature?**
After completing the traditional 108 count, you can continue your practice with extra credits. The app tracks these as "+ extras" (e.g., "108 + 4"), allowing you to extend your meditation when you feel called to continue beyond the sacred number.

**How does the haptic feedback work?**
Gentle vibrations guide your rhythm during practice, helping you maintain consistent timing without looking at the screen. Perfect for maintaining focus during meditation.

**Is my health data private?**
Absolutely. All your health data stays in your Apple Health app - we never see it, store it, or share it. You have complete control, and you can turn health tracking off entirely at any time.

**What is the Session Summary feature?**
After each practice session, ChantFlow can display a notification (2 minutes after completion, giving you time to rest in the silence) showing your session duration and heart rate changes (e.g., "87 → 84 bpm"). This gives you immediate feedback on how your meditation affected your body. You can disable summaries if you prefer to practice without the data.

**What are performance badges?**
ChantFlow analyzes your heart rate improvement during each session and awards performance badges (excellent, very good, or good) based on how much your heart rate decreased. This helps you see which sessions were most effective at helping you find calm.
