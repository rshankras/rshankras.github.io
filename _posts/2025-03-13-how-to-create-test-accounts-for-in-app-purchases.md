Testing in-app purchases and subscriptions is a crucial step in releasing a monetized app. You don't want to use real money during development and testing, and Apple provides a simple solution - sandbox test accounts. In this post, I'll show you how to create and use these accounts to test your in-app purchases without spending real money.

## Why Use Sandbox Test Accounts?

Sandbox test accounts let you:

- Test the full purchase flow without real charges
- Verify subscription renewals (at accelerated time intervals)
- Test upgrade, downgrade, and cancellation flows
- Ensure receipt validation works correctly
- Test the restore purchases functionality

## Step 1: Create Sandbox Test Accounts in App Store Connect

To create a sandbox test account:

1. Log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
2. Click on "Users and Access" in the sidebar
3. Select the "Sandbox" tab
4. Click on "Test Accounts"
5. Click the "+" button to add a new tester
6. Fill in the required information:
   - First Name and Last Name
   - Email Address (use an email you have access to)
   - Password (meeting Apple ID requirements)
   - Select your territory

**Important:** Use a real email address that you own, but one that's not already associated with an Apple ID. You'll need to verify this email.

## Step 2: Configure Your Device for Testing

After creating your sandbox tester, you need to add it to your test device:

1. On your iOS device, go to **Settings**
2. Scroll down and tap on **Developer**
   - If you don't see this option, make sure you've installed your app from Xcode at least once
3. Tap on **StoreKit Testing** or **Sandbox Apple Account**
4. Tap **Add Account** and enter your sandbox account email and password

## Step 3: Test In-App Purchases with Your Sandbox Account

Now you're ready to test purchases:

1. Open your app on your test device
2. Attempt to make a purchase
3. When prompted to sign in with an Apple ID, use your sandbox account credentials
4. Complete the purchase process

The purchase will go through as if it were a real transaction, but no actual money will be charged. You'll see a confirmation showing it's a sandbox purchase.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Sandbox Account Not Working

If your sandbox account isn't working:

- Make sure you've verified the email address
- Check that you're signed out of your regular Apple ID in the App Store
- Restart your device and try again

### "This In-App Purchase Has Already Been Bought" Error

If you see this error:

1. Open Settings â†’ App Store
2. Sign out of your regular Apple ID
3. Try the purchase again, and it will prompt for the sandbox account

## Best Practices

1. Create multiple sandbox accounts to test different scenarios
2. Test all subscription tiers and upgrade/downgrade paths
3. Test purchase restoration functionality
4. Verify receipt validation with your server (if applicable)
5. Test cancellation flows and grace periods

## Conclusion

Setting up sandbox test accounts is essential for properly testing in-app purchases and subscriptions. This approach ensures your monetization features work correctly before your app reaches real users, preventing potential revenue loss and negative reviews.
