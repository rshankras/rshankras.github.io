As an indie developer, I wear many hats — research, design, development, marketing. Doing all of it well (and fast) is hard. Perplexity AI became a simple, reliable research assistant that helped me move faster and make better decisions while building my new app, SleepTracker. I built this during the [RevenueCat Shipaton 2025](https://revenuecat-shipaton-2025.devpost.com) while iterating on the app’s landing page here: [SleepTracker – Solve Your Sleep Riddle](https://www.rshankar.com/sleep-tracker/).

Below is exactly how I used Perplexity across the app lifecycle — with short, reusable prompts you can copy and adapt.

## 1) Market research and competitor analysis

I started by mapping the space: who the leaders are, how they monetize, and what users actually love or hate.

Sample prompt:

```text
List the top 5 apps in [your app category]. For each, outline: core features, pricing model, target users, key strengths, and common user complaints.
```

Why it helped:
- **Fast scan** of the landscape without hours in app stores and review sites
- **Clear gaps** I could fill with simpler UX and clearer insights

## 2) Feature validation and feasibility

Before committing to a feature, I pressure-tested whether it was technically realistic and aligned with platform rules (privacy, permissions, accessibility).

Sample prompt:

```text
Explain the technical feasibility of integrating [specific feature] on [platform, e.g., iOS]. Note HealthKit/privacy permissions, background limits, and accessibility considerations. List potential pitfalls and mitigations.
```

Why it helped:
- Saved me from dead ends and rework
- Kept features compliant and practical

## 3) Target users and personas

I wanted more than demographics — motivations, routines, comfort with technology, and what “success” looks like for them.

Sample prompt:

```text
Create 3 user personas for an app targeting [your demographic]. Include: goals, habits, frustrations, tech comfort, purchase triggers, and what “wins” look like for them.
```

Why it helped:
- Sharper product decisions and copy
- Made it easier to say “no” to nice-to-haves

## 4) Content creation and user education

I used Perplexity to draft friendly, plain-English explanations for onboarding, support pages, and blog posts.

Sample prompt:

```text
Draft a simple, jargon-free intro that explains the benefits of [your core concept], with one short scientific reference and a practical example.
```

Why it helped:
- Clear copy, quickly
- Consistent tone across landing pages, onboarding, and posts

## 5) Marketing strategy and positioning

To stand out, I explored angles, taglines, and content calendars tailored to my audience (e.g., 40+ users who prefer simplicity over dashboards).

Sample prompt:

```text
Suggest 10 concise marketing angles and taglines for an app that helps users understand what affects their sleep (diet, stress, temperature). Target: 40+ audience who want simple, actionable insights.
```

Why it helped:
- Immediate options to test
- Focused language that matched my audience

## Why Perplexity AI felt like a “force multiplier”

- **Speed**: Rapid answers replaced long, manual research sessions
- **Depth**: Synthesizes info with helpful source citations
- **Creative boost**: Jumps-starts copy, personas, and positioning
- **Technical guardrails**: Flags platform and privacy considerations early
- **Cost-effective**: Replaces parts of research/consulting for solo devs
- **Privacy-first thinking**: Keeps sensitive topics (like health data) front and center

## Practical tips if you’re starting now

- Start every prompt with your audience and goal (“Target: 40+, wants simplicity”).
- Ask for constraints (“Call out HealthKit/permissions and accessibility”).
- Request structured output (tables, bullets, pros/cons) for faster scanning.
- Save good prompts as templates and reuse them across features.
- Pair AI with real user feedback — AI accelerates, users validate.

## Closing thoughts

Using Perplexity AI let me turn vague questions into clear, actionable next steps — especially during Shipaton crunch time. If you’re building an app solo (or with a tiny team), tools like Perplexity help you move faster without losing quality.
