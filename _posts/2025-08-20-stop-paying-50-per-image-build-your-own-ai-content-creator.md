*Discover how to build your own AI content creator using Runware's API to generate unlimited marketing visuals for pennies instead of paying $50 per stock photo*

Ever spent hours searching for the perfect stock photo, only to settle for something "close enough" and pay $50 for the privilege? I did this for months while marketing my Apple Watch app [ChantFlow](https://www.rshankar.com/chantflow/) until I discovered something that changed everything.

What if you could generate exactly the image you want, in seconds, for less than a dollar?

That's exactly what I built using Runware's AI API—a simple iOS app that creates unlimited marketing visuals on demand. Here's how you can do the same.<!--more-->

## The Problem: Stock Photos Are Expensive and Generic

ChantFlow is an Apple Watch meditation app that helps users perform traditional chanting practices. Marketing this required very specific imagery—people using Apple Watch during meditation, serene spiritual scenes, the blend of ancient practices with modern tech.

Stock photo sites couldn't deliver what I needed:
- Generic meditation photos (another person sitting cross-legged in a white room)
- Expensive licenses ($20-50 per image)
- Limited selection for niche concepts
- No way to create variations or test different styles

## The Solution: Runware AI API

I discovered Runware AI—an API that generates high-quality images in under a second. No machine learning expertise required, just simple API calls.

What makes Runware special:
- **312,464+ AI models** to choose from
- **Lightning-fast generation** (0.6-4 seconds depending on model)
- **Affordable pricing** (pennies per image vs. $50 stock photos)
- **Easy integration** with any programming language

I built "Mindful Creator," a simple iOS app that uses Runware's API to generate marketing content on demand. [The complete source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/rshankras/PosterApp/tree/main).

## Why Runware Over Other AI Services?

### 1. **Speed**
While other services take 10-30 seconds, Runware generates images in 0.6-4 seconds depending on the model. Perfect for testing multiple ideas quickly.

### 2. **Model Variety** 
Access to 312,464+ models from platforms like CivitAI. Just copy any model's "AIR ID" and use it in your app.

### 3. **Simple Integration**
No complex setup. Just make HTTP requests with your API key—works with any programming language.

### 4. **Affordable**
Generate hundreds of images for what you'd pay for a single stock photo.

## Start Here: The Runware Playground

Before writing any code, use the [Runware Playground](https://my.runware.ai/playground). It's a web-based tool where you can:

1. **Test different AI models** without coding
2. **Adjust parameters** and see results instantly
3. **Copy model IDs** to use in your app
4. **Learn what prompts work best**

*The Runware Playground interface allows you to test different AI models, adjust parameters, and see results instantly. Notice the "Copy AI ID" button that lets you easily copy model IDs for use in your app.*

### Key Tip: Copy AI ID Feature
When you find a model you like, click "Copy AI ID" and paste it into your app. For example, `civitai:4384@128713` gives dreamy, artistic results perfect for wellness apps.

### Writing Good Prompts
Be specific. Instead of "meditation," try:
> "person wearing Apple Watch, meditating peacefully, soft lighting, minimalist room, serene expression"

Add negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements:
> "cluttered, dark, aggressive, scary"

## See It In Action

Here's a simple prompt I used for ChantFlow marketing:

**Prompt:** "person wearing Apple Watch, peaceful meditation pose, soft morning light, minimalist room, serene expression"

![AI-generated meditation image showing person with Apple Watch](/assets/images/ai-content-creator/chantflow-meditation-generated.png)

*AI-generated image of a person wearing an Apple Watch while meditating peacefully in a minimalist room with soft morning light - exactly what I needed for ChantFlow marketing.*

**Cost:** $0.0273 per image 

Compare that to spending hours searching stock photo sites and paying $50 for something that's only "close enough."

## The App I Built

The [Mindful Creator app](https://github.com/rshankras/PosterApp/tree/main) is a simple iOS app with these features:

- **Easy prompting**: Text input with helpful suggestions
- **Multiple models**: Switch between different AI styles
- **Batch generation**: Create 1-4 images at once
- **Various sizes**: Square, portrait, landscape, story formats
- **Save to Photos**: Export directly to your photo library
- **Cost tracking**: See how much you're spending

    <p><em>View and save your generated image</em></p>
  </div>
</div>

*The complete Mindful Creator workflow: from input to style selection to final generated image with metadata.*

### The Basic API Call
Here's the core of how it works:

```swift
let request = RunwareImageRequest(
    prompt: "person using Apple Watch for meditation",
    aspectRatio: .square,
    aiModel: .dreamShaper,
    numberResults: 4
)
```

That's it. No complex machine learning setup required.

## The Results: Before vs After

**Before Runware:**
- Hours searching stock photos
- $20-50 per image
- Settling for "close enough"
- Limited to existing photos

**After Runware:**
- Generate exactly what I need in 30 seconds
- $0.50 for 4 variations
- Perfect match to my vision
- Unlimited iterations

## Quick Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific**: "person using Apple Watch during morning meditation" vs "meditation"
2. **Use negative prompts**: Exclude unwanted elements like "cluttered, dark, aggressive"
3. **Try different models**: Each has its own style—experiment in the playground first
4. **Generate multiple variations**: Create 3-4 options and pick the best

## Why This Matters

As an indie developer, I can now compete visually with big companies. No more $1000+ design budgets or settling for generic stock photos. I generate exactly what ChantFlow needs to stand out.
