# SEO System for rshankar.com

**Quick Start Guide** for improving SEO across your Jekyll blog.

## 📚 What's Been Implemented

Your blog now has a complete SEO infrastructure:

1. ✅ **Automatic meta tags** (canonical, Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
2. ✅ **Structured data** (JSON-LD for rich snippets)
3. ✅ **Smart fallbacks** (uses excerpt when description missing)
4. ✅ **Documentation** (guidelines, templates, checklists)
5. ✅ **Audit tools** (script to track progress)

## 🚀 Quick Start (15 Minutes)

### 1. Check Current Status
```bash
./scripts/seo-audit.sh
```

This shows you exactly what needs work.

### 2. Update Your First Post

Pick any recent post and add these three lines:

```yaml
---
title: "Existing Title"
date: "2025-11-01"
description: "Write 120-155 characters describing what readers will learn from this post."
image: "/assets/images/post-slug/featured.png"
permalink: "/descriptive-post-slug/"
---
```

That's it! The infrastructure handles the rest.

### 3. Test It

1. Build your site locally or push to GitHub
2. View the page source
3. Look for `<meta name="description"...>`
4. Check for `<script type="application/ld+json">` (structured data)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Fastest Impact
Focus on **recent posts first** (2024-2025):
- Already getting traffic
- More relevant to current readers
- Better conversion to followers

### Minimum Viable SEO
For maximum efficiency, just add:
1. Meta description (5 min)
2. Featured image path (2 min)

That's 7 minutes per post for 80% of the benefit!

### Default Image Strategy
Don't have time for custom images?
1. Create ONE default template image
2. Use for all posts initially
3. Replace with custom later

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Create a New Post
```bash
# Copy template
cp _templates/new-post-template.md _posts/2025-11-01-my-new-post.md

# Edit with your favorite editor
code _posts/2025-11-01-my-new-post.md

# Fill in all SEO fields
# Write content
# Check off the checklist at bottom
```

### Update an Old Post
```bash
# Open the post
code _posts/2014-01-01-old-post.md

# Add these lines to front matter:
description: "120-155 character description here"
image: "/assets/images/default-featured.png"
permalink: "/descriptive-slug/"

# Save and commit
```

### Check Your Progress
```bash
# Run audit
./scripts/seo-audit.sh

# Compare to previous run
./scripts/seo-audit.sh > status-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt

# Review improvement over time
diff status-20251101.txt status-20251201.txt
```

### Find Posts to Update
```bash
# Posts missing descriptions
grep -L "description:" _posts/*.md | head -10

# Recent posts missing descriptions
grep -L "description:" _posts/2024-*.md _posts/2025-*.md

# High priority (recent + missing desc)
ls -t _posts/2024-*.md _posts/2025-*.md | head -20 | xargs grep -L "description:"
```

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Do I need to update all 429 posts?**
A: No! Start with recent posts (2024-2025). That's only 57 posts and will give you 80% of the benefit.

**Q: How long does each post take?**
A:
- Quick fix: 5 minutes (description + permalink)
- Standard: 10 minutes (+ image + tags)
- Complete: 30 minutes (+ custom image + optimization)

**Q: What if I don't have time for custom images?**

A:
1. View page source (right-click → View Source)

3. Search for `application/ld+json`
